- You work on the Mac Book Pro with M4 Max, 64GB RAM and macOS 26+. Always take it intoaccount when work. Give No suggestions / information for other OS.

- Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
